# Kevin-Pham---Projects

This repository contains selected data analytics and economics projects completed through academic work and personal exploration. The projects demonstrate my ability to clean and analyze real-world data, apply statistical and econometric methods, and communicate insights through clear analysis, visualizations, and dashboards.

**Tools & Technologies**

My work primarily uses Python and R with libraries such as pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, tidyverse, and Matplotlib. Several projects also use Power BI for dashboard development and public or API-based data sources including NBA and NFL datasets.

**Projects**

The Economic Impact of Sports Games project analyzes the short-term economic effects of NFL and NBA games on host cities using regression analysis. The NFL Player Profile Visualizer processes NFL Next Gen Stats to explore position-specific performance trends. The Community Health and Infrastructure Dashboard examines county-level relationships between access to exercise infrastructure and economic outcomes in Florida. The NBA Player Performance Predictor uses historical player data and regression models to forecast future performance metrics.

**About Me**

I am a recent Economics graduate with a concentration in Data Science, interested in analytical roles involving reporting, dashboards, and data-driven decision-making. I bring a structured, detail-oriented approach to analysis and focus on producing accurate, well-documented work.
